## Setup
Firstly, install all the packages by running
```
npm install
```
If you wish to customise some of the server's functionality, such as port, create a `.env` file in the root with the following
```env
PORT=80
```

## Running
Starting the server can be done by running
```
npm run build
npm start
```
For developers, to watch your files and automatically compile the TypeScript files, run
```
npm run dev
```
